# split_encrypt_script
Breaks an input file into encrypted chunks and packages them into a zip container

_Note: For use with decrypt_concat_script (https://github.com/SpawnID0000/decrypt_concat_script)_

Before running this script, install or upgrade Python's cryptography module if not already running the latest:

     pip show cryptography

     pip install --upgrade cryptography

_Also note: Uses Unix split command, so modification may be needed if running on a Windows computer_
